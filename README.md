## 👋 Hi, I'm Stephen

I'm a software developer based in **Norwich, UK** 🇬🇧  
I build tools, libraries and engines — because I love understanding how things *actually* work under the hood.

I don’t just use tech.  
I **discipline** myself to *understand* the tech.

I write, I test, I break, I fix — and then I simplify.  
Software is craft. Software is engineering. Software is *art*.

### 🛠 What I care about

- clean architecture
- low-level protocols + networking
- building dev tools people actually use
- C# / .NET
- game tech + engine tech

### 🚧 Projects I’m building

### final note

I don’t want to “just code”.

I want to **understand systems** deeply  
and then build things that help others understand them too.
